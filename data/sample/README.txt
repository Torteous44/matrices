# Sample Images for 3D Reconstruction

This directory should contain 10-20 sample images for demonstration of the 3D reconstruction pipeline.

## Sample Image Requirements

- Image format: JPG or PNG
- Resolution: 1280x960 or similar
- Content: Object or scene captured from multiple viewpoints with ~60-80% overlap between consecutive views
- The scene should have good texture and feature points
- Avoid reflective or transparent surfaces for best results

## Placeholder Note

Since this repository does not include actual image files due to size constraints, you should:

1. Replace this file with your own set of photos, or
2. Download a sample dataset such as the publicly available "Temple Ring" dataset and extract the images here

## Example Data Sources

- [Middlebury Multi-View Stereo Dataset](https://vision.middlebury.edu/mview/data/)
- [ETH3D Dataset](https://www.eth3d.net/)
- [TUM-RGBD Dataset](https://cvg.cit.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset)

## Using Your Own Photos

For best results when capturing your own photos:
- Use a DSLR or smartphone with good camera quality
- Maintain consistent lighting
- Capture images in a circular pattern around the object
- Ensure some overlap between consecutive images
- Avoid motion blur by using a tripod or high shutter speed
